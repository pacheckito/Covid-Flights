# CovidFlights
Delta Airlines is one of the largest airlines in the world and, like many other airlines, was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this project, we investigate the impact of cancelled Delta flights on the Delta stock price at the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), which is one of Delta's largest hubs. We merge ATL airport data with Delta stock price data to analyze the relationship between cancelled flights and stock prices during the pandemic. By examining the correlation between the two variables, we can gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on Delta's financial performance. The project includes data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling techniques to uncover any patterns or trends in the data. The results of the analysis may provide valuable insights for investors and analysts who are interested in Delta Airlines' performance during the pandemic.
